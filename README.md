# Anomaly-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project
A project which classifies video segments as 'normal' or 'anomalous' (shoplifting).

To run the code, you first of all need to go to the frame extraction and segmentation file. Update the path directoryy for the videos so it matches your storage.
Run the code and wait for it do the frame extraction/segmentation/pre-processing. 

Once finished you can than run each python file and wait for the model to finish.
I created this in jupiter noteboks on google colab so you can also mvoe the code over to that platform
